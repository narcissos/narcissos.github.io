        <p><strong><em>[Sound Effect: Spacebar]</em></strong></p>
        <p>It all started with Undertale.</p>
        <p><strong><em>[Music: Undertale by Toby Fox]</em></strong></p>
        <p>The reason I became so well-rounded on the internet and actively try to grow as a digital writer started with Undertale in 2015. At first glance, it was just a funny game with talking skeletons named after fonts.</p>
        <p><strong><em>[Music stops]</em></strong></p>
        <p>Until it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
        <p><strong><em>[Music: Club Moka by Blue Dot Sessions]</em></strong></p>
        <p>There was a moral to be learned. A story to walk away with. One so moving, I thought about it for weeks afterwards. I couldn&rsquo;t even listen to the soundtrack without shedding a tear.</p>
        <p>And for me, that was an inspiring moment. I wanted to leave my own mark on the world through good writing. Obviously, I knew my magnum opus wasn&rsquo;t going to come immediately, but it had to start somewhere, right? I decided it was time to go on a journey and find my way there.</p>
        <p><strong><em>[Music: Slow Rollout by Blue Dot Sessions]</em></strong></p>
        <p>Social media was the doorway into the digital world, but I didn&rsquo;t start taking it seriously until Tumblr. I learned that digital writing is much more than just text. It also includes aesthetics, multimodality, and carefully combining them together.</p>
        <p>I tried WordPress but it didn&rsquo;t really work out the same way. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what content I should even be posting since all my interests already had blogs dedicated to them. What made me any different? I quickly got discouraged, and back to Tumblr I went.</p>
        <p>I was even a fanfic author. I spent a lot of time learning to write for an audience and eventually racked up a decent number of reads. A large part of this included accepting criticism to better my writing, and interacting with avid readers in a professional, yet personal way.</p>
        <p><strong><em>[Music: Night Watch by Blue Dot Sessions]</em></strong></p>
        <p>During this time of self-discovery, I even collaborated with a team of artists to make a digital charity zine for an LGBT shelter in South Korea. We raised a few hundred dollars off a very limited run, and I was stunned when I realized writing had connected me across the globe to Asia.</p>
        <p>I kept trying new things for the sake of it. Art, Photoshop, Video-Editing, I even designed a book with a follower of mine now available at <a href="https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/farfalla/9780578816173-item.html">Indigo</a>. Each one of these experiences became a notch on my belt. Eventually, I realized something, both about digital authoring and about myself.</p>
        <p><strong><em>[Music stops]</em></strong></p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s a process.</p>
        <p><strong><em>[Music: In the Box by Blue Dot Sessions]</em></strong></p>
        <p>Digital authoring taught me about authenticity. I&rsquo;m not saying spill your life story out for total strangers&hellip; but who cares about telling universal stories that <em>everyone</em> can relate to? What about your own story? Whether it&rsquo;s your gender, ethnicity, age, or anything else&hellip; there&rsquo;s value in your experience, shared or not.</p>
        <p>I keep learning to think more critically about my identity and who I want to be on the internet. To present my own authentic self and tap into the everchanging cyberspace around us.</p>
        <p><strong><em>[Music: Speaker Joy by Blue Dot Sessions]</em></strong></p>
        <p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been interested in visual novels&mdash;text-based video games featuring art, music, and interactivity. Readers have stakes as they alter the story with their choices. Open-sourced programs like Twine and game engines like Unity have given me these affordances.</p>
        <p>Of course, learning the required languages of JavaScript and Python is easier said than done, but with a little (or a lot of) hard work&hellip; it&rsquo;s within reach.</p>
        <p>And I&rsquo;m sure, either in a few weeks or months or years, I&rsquo;ll find something else that interests me, and keep learning and growing as a digital author. Because remember. It&rsquo;s all a process.</p>
        <p>My name is Amanda, and this has been my digital authoring practices.</p>
